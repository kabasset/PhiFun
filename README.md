# PhiFun

This project is a sandbox for implementing and measuring transforms for PSF estimation by phase diversity.
Î¦ (Phi) is the conventional symbol for the phase, and optics is fun, thus the name!

It is organized in modules, generally named after the researcher behind the developed feature:
* PhiFourier for [DFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform)
* PhiZernike for [Zernike polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zernike_polynomials)
* PhiDuffieux for [optical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_optics)
* (PhiBox is a messy toolbox)

For details on the context, refer to [the technical note on phase diversity](doc/pd.ipynb).
